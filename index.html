				The Tesla Gigafactory 1 is a lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factory near Reno, Nevada. 
				The facility is owned and operated by Tesla, Inc. to supply the battery packs for its electric vehicles and stationary storage systems. 
				It is located at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC) in Storey County, and employs around 3,000 people as of August 2018. 
				The factory started limited production of Powerwalls and Powerpacks in the first quarter of 2016 using battery cells produced elsewhere, 
				and began mass production of cells in January 2017. 
				Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval estimated that Nevada would enjoy $100 billion in economic benefit over two decades from the construction and operation of this factory. 
				The grand opening event was held on July 29, 2016. 
				Gigafactory 1, in Nevada, is aligned on true north, which was done so that the equipment can be mapped by GPS and solar panels on the roof can be accurately aligned. 
				The factory has also been designed to become entirely energy self-reliant. Tesla intends to power the structure through a combination of on-site solar, wind and geo-thermal sources. 
				The building will have the largest footprint in the world and second largest volume when completed.

				The Tesla Gigafactory 2 is a photovoltaic (PV) cell factory leased by Tesla subsidiary SolarCity in Buffalo, New York. 
				The factory, owned by the State of New York, 
				was built on brownfield land remediated from a former steel mill. 
				Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2016–17. 
				In 2013, the site of Gigafactory 2 was planned as a clean energy business incubation center. 
				As SolarCity acquired Silevo in 2014 and merged into Tesla two years later, the factory was planned. The factory, 
				in a partnership with Panasonic, started limited assembly of photovoltaic modules in 2017 using imported Japanese PV cells. 
				It began commercial production of modules in 2017. In 2018, SolarCity began production of individual solar cells.In late 2019, 
				Tesla announced that it would begin commercial installation of version 3 of its "Solar Roof" product over the following few months.

				The facility will produce battery cells along with Tesla Model 3 and Tesla Model Y cars, at an initial production rate target of 250,000 electric cars per year. 
				The Shanghai regional government approved the agreement to build the production facility in July 2018, and a long-term lease was signed for about 86 hectares (210 acres) of land in October 2018. 
				Construction began in December 2018 with the installation of secure fencing and site offices. 
				The General Assembly Building was nearly complete by August 2019, and manufacturing line equipment was being installed for both batteries and automobiles. 
				News reports in August noted production could start as early as November 2019, and CNBC reports that Tesla is expected to manufacture more than 6000 vehicles at Gigafactory 3 by year-end 2019. 
				The plant had begun initial production of Tesla Model 3 cars by October 2019. While trial production on the general assembly line continues, additional production facilities for motors, seats, 
				and powertrain assemblies are under construction in late 2019 with expected completion by March 2020.

				but the driver must supervise continuously and take control if there is an issue. This feature is called Autopilot. Sentry mode is available on Autopilot hardware 2+, 
				built after August 2017. Sentry Mode senses and records suspicious activity around the car. 
				Autopilot 2.0 also includes Enhanced Summon, which allows the car to drive through a parking lot to find you, without anybody in the driver's seat. 
				Maximum distance is 200 feet and summoner must monitor the car and is responsible. 
				The EPA rated the 2017 90D Model S's energy consumption at 3.096 miles per kWh (200.9 watt-hours per kilometer or 32.33 kWh/100 mi or 20.09 kWh/100 km)
				for a combined fuel economy of 104 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (2.26 L/100 km or 125 mpg‑imp). 
				In 2016, Tesla updated the design of the Model S to closely match that of the Model X.
				In April 2019, Tesla dropped the kWh branding in favor of the three named versions: Standard Range, Long Range, and Performance.
				In July 2019, Tesla discontinued the Standard Range configuration, leaving just the Long Range and Performance versions available.

				Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/; born June 28, 1971) is a technology entrepreneur, investor, and engineer. 
				He holds South African, Canadian, and U.S. citizenship and is the founder, CEO, and chief engineer/designer of SpaceX; 
				CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; co-founder of Neuralink; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI. 
				He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018. 
				In December 2016, he was ranked 21st on the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People, and was ranked (co-)first on the Forbes list of the Most Innovative Leaders of 2019. 
				He has a net worth of $22.8 billion and is listed by Forbes as the 40th-richest person in the world.
				He is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.
				Born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk moved to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, 
				where he received a Bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences. 
				He began a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University in 1995 but dropped out after two days to pursue an entrepreneurial career. 
				He subsequently co-founded Zip2 with his brother Kimbal, a web software company, which was acquired by Compaq for $340 million in 1999. 
				Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.
				In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He joined Tesla, Inc., 
				an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded, and became its CEO and product architect.

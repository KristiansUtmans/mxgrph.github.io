                                &emsp; The Tesla Model S is an all-electric five-door liftback sedan,
                                produced by Tesla, Inc., and introduced on June 22, 2012.
                                As of April 23, 2019, the Model S Long Range has an EPA range of 373 miles (600 km),
                                which is higher than any other battery electric car.
                            </p>

                                &emsp; The Tesla Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016,
                                and by the end of 2018 continued to rank as the second most-sold electric car in history after
                                the Nissan Leaf. The December 2017 Consumer Reports owner satisfaction survey had the Tesla Model S
                                at the top. In 2019, the US magazine Motor Trend named the 2013
                                Tesla Model S the ultimate car of the year over the magazine's 70-year history.

                                &emsp; The Tesla Model X is a mid-size all-electric luxury SUV made by Tesla, Inc.
                                The vehicle is unique in the concept that it uses falcon wing doors instead
                                of traditional automotive doors. The prototype was unveiled at Tesla's design studios in Hawthorne,
                                California on February 9, 2012. The Model X has an official EPA rated 250–325 mi (402–523km)
                                range and the combined fuel economy equivalent and energy consumption for the AWD P90D was rated
                                at 89 mpg‑e (39 kWh/100mi).

                                &emsp; The Model X was developed from the full-sized sedan platform of the Tesla Model S.
                                The Model X has an EPA Size Class as an SUV, and shares ~30% of its content with the Model S,
                                half of the originally planned ~60%, and weighs about 10 percent more, both are being produced at the
                                Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. First deliveries of the Model X began in September 2015.
                                After one full year on the market, the Model X ranked in 2016 seventh among the world's best-selling plug-in cars.
                                Global cumulative sales since inception totaled 106,689 units through September 2018.

                                It was unveiled in March 2019, with deliveries planned to begin in summer 2020. 
                                It is Tesla's second vehicle built upon the tier-3 mass-market-vehicle platform, alongside the Model 3.
                                Model Y will offer optional third-row seats for a seven-passenger seating capacity.

                                Standard Range, Long Range, Long Range with Dual-Motor All-Wheel Drive, and Performance.
                                As of October 2019, all models were planned to be available by summer 2020,
                                except the Standard Range model which is expected 6 months later.
                                The Model Y fills a smaller size segment from its bigger sibling,
                                the tier-2 premium market Tesla Model X.

                                The Model 3 carries full self-driving hardware,
                                with periodic software updates adding additional functionality.

                                Tesla revealed they had taken 325,000 reservations for the car. 
                                These reservations represented potential sales of over US$14 billion.
                                By August 2017, there were 455,000 net reservations.

                                Three models have been announced, with range estimates of 250–500 miles (400–800 km)
                                and an estimated 0–60 mph time of 2.9–6.5 seconds, depending on the model.

                                &emsp; The truck will use self-leveling suspension which compensates for variable load and some models
                                will have all-wheel drive. Other standard features include on-board power inverters for supplying
                                both 120 and 240-volt electricity, allowing use of power tools without a portable generator.
                                An air compressor for powering pneumatic tools is included.
                                The exterior stainless steel sheet-metal is bullet-resistant against 9 mm caliber bullets as well.
                                All vehicles will also come standard with Tesla Autopilot, and will have the hardware capabilities
                                for fully autonomous operation.
